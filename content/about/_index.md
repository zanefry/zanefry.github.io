Welcome to my humble blog. I'm a new analyst and made this site primarily to document
my exploration of topics within infosec, although you may find the occassional post on
something adjascent or entirely unrelated. My blog is built with [Zola](https://www.getzola.org),
a compact static site generator written by [Vincent Prouillet](https://www.vincentprouillet.com/) in rust,
and is hosted by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). It uses the
[Tale](https://www.getzola.org/themes/tale-zola/) Zola theme.
